This script parses file system metadata discovered in disk images by Brunnhilde, and uploads that metadata as archival objects to an ArchivesSpace instance using the ArchivesSpace API. The current version extracts and transfers the following information:

* File formats identified (extracted from Siegfried report)
* Aggregate size of files, reported in megabytes (calculated from Siegfried report)
* Total file count (calculated from Siegfried report)
* Date range of last-modified timestamps (extracted from fiwalk-generated DFXML)

## Setup and Installation

This script is intended to be run in the BitCurator environment (includes all required dependencies other than **pandas**, **pathlib**, and **xmltodict** which are automatically installed by this script) or a similarly configured Linux host. 

When running in a non-BitCurator environment, **Brunnhilde** must be installed first. Installation instructions can be found at https://github.com/timothyryanwalsh/brunnhilde.

All commands from this point forward are presented as if working as the **bcadmin** user in BitCurator. First, open a terminal and check out the lastest version of this repo from GitHub:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ git clone https://github.com/bitcurator/bc_to_aspace_toolkit
```

Install with the following commands:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ cd bc_to_aspace_toolkit
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ python3 setup.py build
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## Analyzing a sample disk image with Brunnhilde and The Sleuth Kit

A simple example with the included sample disk image is provided here.

This script assumes you have a working ArchivesSpace instance running on another host, or in a VM accessible from your host. Looking for a simple way to get a test instance of ArchivesSpace up and running? You can build one with Vagrant and VirtualBox using our deployment tool at https://github.com/bitcurator/aspace_vagrant.

Ensure you're in the **bc_to_aspace_toolkit** directory, then copy the provided sample image to your home directory:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ cd ~/bc_to_aspace_toolkit
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ cp sample_disk_images/nps-2010-emails.E01 ~/
```

The Brunnhilde script uses a tool provided by The Sleuth Kit, **tsk_recover**, to extract files from disk images. The **tsk_recover** tool will make a best effort to autodetect disk image type, file system type, and partition offset, but this does not always work. Another tool provided by The Sleuth Kit, **mmls**, can assist in identifying partitions and their associated offsets. The features and limitations of both **tsk_recover** and **mmls** are beyond the scope of this README. **You should familiarize yourself with the operation of these tools before attempting to use the techniques presented in this example with your own materials.**

For this example, we know this is most likely an Expert Witness (E01) file based on the file extension; we can use the **mmls** tool to find the partition information:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/bc_to_aspace_toolkit$ cd ~/
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ mmls nps-2010-emails.E01
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Unallocated
002:  000:000   0000000001   0000020479   0000020479   Win95 FAT32 (0x0b)
```

This tells us there is a FAT32 file system located at sector 1 (512 bytes into the image). We can pass this information through to **tsk_recover** via Brunnhilde as follows:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ brunnhilde.py -z -b --tsk_imgtype ewf --tsk_fstype fat --tsk_sector_offset 1 -d nps-2010-emails.E01 /home/bcadmin brunnhilde-reports
```

This extracts all files into the directory **brunnhilde-reports** in our home directory, **/home/bcadmin**. Note the **-z** flag at the beginning, which tells Brunnhilde to run Siegfried in order to scan compressed files; the **-b** flag, which tells Brunnhilde to run **bulk_extractor** and create the default reports; and the **-d** flag indicating we are providing a path to a disk image. Be aware! The process of running these tools may take some time.

Change directory into the **brunnhilde-reports** directory and examine the contents. Then, change directory into the **csv_reports** directory that it contains and examine those contents:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ cd brunnhilde-reports/
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/brunnhilde-reports$ ls
bulk_extractor  csv_reports  logs         siegfried.csv
carved_files    dfxml.xml    report.html  tree.txt
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/brunnhilde-reports$ cd csv_reports/
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/brunnhilde-reports/csv_reports$ ls
duplicates.csv  formats.csv         mimetypes.csv     warnings.csv
errors.csv      formatVersions.csv  unidentified.csv  years.csv
```

## Creating local repository, project, and dataset folders

We need the **formats.csv**, **siegfried.csv**, and (optionally) **dfxml.xml** files to complete our transfer to our ArchivesSpace instance with **bc_to_as.py**. Prior to running the script, we need to create a folder structure that exactly matches the name of our repository, the names of the projects contained within that repository, and the named datasets contained within each project. We'll copy the complete contents of **brunnhilde-reports** into that folder in an upcoming step.

The script will transfer metadata for any new datasets found within this directory structure, and will create the project(s) in the specified (existing) repository in the ArchivesSpace instance with these exact, case-sensitive names if they do not already exist.

First, return to your home directory and create a folder corresponding to a repository name. For this simple example, we'll call it **test_repository**.

**Note:** You **must** either create this repository from the staff interface of your ArchivesSpace instance before proceeding, or substitute the name of an existing repository as the directory name.

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ cd ~/
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ mkdir test_repository
```

Now, create a project directory inside the repository directory. Repository directories can contain more than one project.

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ cd test_repository/
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/test_repository$ mkdir project1
```

Now, change into the project directory and make a directory corresponding to our dataset (we'll copy Brunnhilde output we created earlier into this directory next). Name this dataset **SET1_brunnout**. The portion of the name preceding the underscore (**SET1**) will be used as the reference ID when calling the ArchivesSpace API:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/test_repository$ cd project1/
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/test_repository/project1$ mkdir SET1_brunnout
```

Now copy the content of the brunnhilde-reports folder:

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/test_repository/project1$ cp -r ~/brunnhilde-reports/* SET1_brunnout
```

## Running the script

Finally, run the **bc_to_as.py** script. We'll pass it the location of our local directory structure as an argument. When the script runs, you will see several prompts to confirm the location and structure of local directory corresponding to the named repository. Then you will need to authenticate with a user that has permissions to create and modify repositories and their contents on ArchivesSpace. For this simple example, we'll use the default **admin** user (the default admin password for ArchivesSpace is also **admin**; the password is not shown below, but must be typed in):

```shell
bcadmin@ubuntu:~/test_repository/project1$ cd ~/
bcadmin@ubuntu:~$ bc_to_as.py /home/bcadmin/test_repository/

  [INFO] Found repository structure directory /home/bcadmin/test_repository

```

You should now see the unpublished **test_repository** listed in your ArchivesSpace console (assuming you are logged in). Select the repository, select the **Browse** menu, and click **Resources**. You should see **project1** listed as a Resource. Select the **View** button inside the **project1** resource pane. In the new view, click on the drop-down arrow next to **project1** (near the top of the page) to view the imported metadata associated with the **SET1** dataset.
